# OpenCV Mini Projects

This repository contains various small projects using OpenCV for computer vision tasks. Each script demonstrates a different OpenCV feature, such as object detection, edge detection, gesture recognition, and more.

## Projects Included

- **BlurDetection.py** → Detects and analyzes image blurriness.
- **ColorDetection.py** → Identifies and tracks specific colors in an image or video.
- **Edge&ContourDetection.py** → Detects edges and contours in an image.
- **FaceDetection.py** → Detects faces in images or video streams using OpenCV.
- **FaceMesh.py** → Tracks facial landmarks and creates a facial mesh.
- **HandGesture.py** → Detects and tracks hand gestures.
- **MoucClickDetection.py** → Detects mouse clicks and interactions on an image.
- **MovingObjectDetector.py** → Detects moving objects in a video stream.
- **QRcode.py** → Detects and decodes QR codes in an image.

## Requirements

Install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## Usage

Run any script using:
```bash
python script_name.py
```
Example:
```bash
python FaceDetection.py
